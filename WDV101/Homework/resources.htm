    <h1>Student Resources for HTML</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.learn-html.org/" target="_blank">www.learn-html.org</a><p>This one starts with the basic Hello World program like with any programming language. The great aspect of this one is the ability to test some code, right there on the page, just like w3schools. It starts with the basics but works up to things like bootstrap, etc.</p></li>
      <li><a href="https://html.com/" target="_blank">html.com</a><p>I like this one because it has different levels for where you can begin, like beginner and advanced. It helps you create your webpage in minutes, not hours, days, or months.</p></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">www.codecademy.com</a><p>This is a good one for HTML and other languages and is free, which is great. You do have to create a username and password. It does have the ability to upgrade to Pro</p></li>
      <li><a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank">learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/</a><p>This is a free one that helps you build your first webpage and then adds components as you go, a lot like HTML CSS class. The format and fact that the information is right up front make this a resource I am likely to use again.</p></li>
      <li><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/learn/html" target="_blank">teamtreehouse.com/learn/html</a><p>While this one is not free, it has a free trial so you can give it a try. There is a review that states how the videos help with the "Aha" moments. This website provides a great foundation. You can build your own projects in about 6-12 months.</p></li>
