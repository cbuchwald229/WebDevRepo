          <h1>About Mermaids</h1>
          <p>There are many legends about mermaids and some dozens of claims from the history that stand in support of ‘real’ mermaid sightings. Sailors and residents of coastal towns all around the world have recited stories about their encounters with the sea-maidens. One story dates back to the 1600s. It claimed that a mermaid tried to enter Holland through a dike and was injured in her efforts. She was taken to a nearby lake and nursed. Eventually, she became a productive citizen, learnt Dutch, performed household chores and converted to Catholicism.</p>
          <p>There are many such legends of mermaids. They may be ancient but their existence is prevalent in many forms even today including films, books, movies and even Starbucks.</p>
          <p>Nearly three quarters of the Earth is covered with water. No wonder, oceans contained various mysterious creatures like mermaids and sea serpents, some of them might be in existence even today. Merfolk, namely mermen and mermaids are the only marine version of half animal and half human legends that have captured human imagination since ages.</p>
          <p>The male members of underwater race of merfolk called as merman are supposedly more shy and secretive than their female counterparts. Nearly all stories suggest that mermen never came to the surface of ocean whereas mermaids have been very active in their appearances on the ocean’s surface.</p>
