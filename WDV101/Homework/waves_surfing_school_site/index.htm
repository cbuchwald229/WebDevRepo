          </figcaption>
            <p>James is one of our locals who didn't experience surfing until well within his 30s. Now he will never look back. As a local programmer, he looks for ways to get out and get exercise and he's found his perfect match. We couldn't be happier! One of our master surfers.<p>

            <p>This great guy decided to pack up his things and take a vacation here with us to learn surfing. What a drastic difference to the courts that see him in New York today. Surfing has brought out the happy, laid back personality of this young man. What difference can surfing make to you?</p>

          </figcaption>
            <p>Sally is one of our best students we have ever had the pleasure of working with. Never talks back, and does exactly as told. Like any good beginner, she wears a life vest to keep her safe, although an avid swimmer. She still comes by weekly to practice. Come surf with Sally!</p>
