          <p>Get a thorough and personalized introduction to surfing with your own instructor in our Private lessons. Ages 5 and up. There is no more effective way to learn to surf than by having the undivided attention of a professional instructor to guide you through the pitfalls and get you up and riding your own waves. You’re pretty much guaranteed to get up on your first lesson. Or, for a more thorough introduction to surfing, our Private Surf Lesson Packages might be more suited to your needs. In successive lessons, our students learn how to turn, how to read and select waves, techniques to paddle out through the break, how to best maneuver the board, timing, etiquette, tides and other factors affecting wave quality, and more. In general, most people get a solid basic intro in a 3-lesson package, and are able to consistently catch waves and stand on their own. In a 5-lesson package, most are able to turn fairly consistently after catching a wave. After a 7-lesson package, many are able to identify a ride able open-face wave, and have moderate success at maneuvering themselves into position to catch it. Let us help you take your surfing to the next level!</p>
          <p>We book the surf lessons to fit your schedule, and all equipment is provided. Lessons are provided in all locations. Surf lessons are 1 hour and 45 minutes long and include all the equipment.</p>

          <p><b>Ages 13 and Up – Open Enrollment</b></p>
          <p>Our Progressive Group Classes provide ongoing instruction for both beginners and more advanced students. Provided there are enough registrants, lessons are broken into more and less experienced surfers so that the instruction can be tailored to the student’s skill level. We teach beginning surfing every week, while taking more advanced students’ skills to the next level. Classes are small – with a maximum ratio of up to 5:1. Surf lessons are 1 hour and 45 minutes long and include all the equipment. Call or email for availability. All are welcome – come join the fun!</p>
